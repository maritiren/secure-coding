## Pluralsight
Pluralsight has a topic called ["Secure by design"](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/information-cyber-security/secure-by-design). 
Secure by design is a nice consept for ensuring secure development. In this 
topic, there are several "paths" that may be followed. Each path contain 
several courses within a certain topic. Each path usually has courses for people
with different experience level such as `Beginner`, `Intermediate` and 
`Advanced`.

Paths:
* [Web Application Security](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/web-application-security)
* [Application Security on Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/application-security-on-microsoft-azure)
*

Courses:
As I personally haven't watched any of these yet, I cannot recommend any. I do
however like Pluralsight courses a lot and I am pretty sure those at the bottom
of [this page](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/information-cyber-security/secure-by-design)
should be nice to get to learn some things about secure coding.
