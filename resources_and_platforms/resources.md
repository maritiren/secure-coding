# Resources

This document lists resources like video courses or blog posts that are nice to
get started with secure coding. Here is a summary of the content:

* [OWASP](#owasp-open-web-application-security-project)
* [Pluralsight](#pluralsight)

## OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project
OWASP plays an important role for secure coding. OWASP is short for the Open
Web Application Security project. If you haven't heard about it,
you should definitely read about [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
which lists the ten most found vulnerabilities in a bunch of applications from
the recent years. This list is a good resource of common vulnerabilities to
prevent introducing to your application. Also, I would really recommmend to
read about [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
as well, as it contains a list of requirements that you might want to include
to your development project!


## Pluralsight
Pluralsight has a topic called ["Secure by design"](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/information-cyber-security/secure-by-design). 
Secure by design is a nice consept for ensuring secure development. In this 
topic, there are several "paths" that may be followed. Each path contain 
several courses within a certain topic. Each path usually has courses for people
with different experience level such as `Beginner`, `Intermediate` and 
`Advanced`.

Paths:
* [Web Application Security](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/web-application-security)
* [Application Security on Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/application-security-on-microsoft-azure)
*

Courses:
As I personally haven't watched any of these yet, I cannot recommend any. I do
however like Pluralsight courses a lot and I am pretty sure those at the bottom
of [this page](https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/information-cyber-security/secure-by-design)
should be nice to get to learn some things about secure coding.
