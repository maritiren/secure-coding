# Platforms for practical exercises

In this file platforms for secure coding practice are listed. Here is a table
with the contents of this file:

* [Secure Code Warrior](#secure-code-warrior)
* [OWASP Secure Coding Dojo](#owasp-secure-coding-dojo)

## Secure Code Warrior
[Secure Code Warrior](https://securecodewarrior.com/) is a platform that has 
several modes such as `training`, `tournament` and `assessment`.

The platform is free for 21 days. It seems to be made for enterprise, but they 
might appear at university events as well, or may do some deals with some unis
as far as I understand.

## OWASP Secure Coding Dojo
OWASP plays an important role for secure coding. OWASP is short for the Open 
Web Application Security project. If you haven't heard about it,
you should definitely read about [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
which lists the ten most found vulnerabilities in a bunch of applications from 
the recent years. This list is a good resource of common vulnerabilities to 
prevent introducing to your application. Also, I would really recommmend to 
read about [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
as well, as it contains a list of requirements that you might want to include 
to your development project!

Oh, I got a little carried away. OWASP also provides us with several platforms 
for practicing secure coding. One of them is [OWASP Secure Coding Dojo](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-dojo/).

When setting up the Secure Coding Dojo, 

## OWASP Juice Shop
There is some information about OWASP and some nice resources you should check
out above. [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) is a
vulnerable web application that you run locally on your own machine.

The platform is nice for testing your skills, but migth be a little difficult
if you have no previous experience or knowledge. However, the platform has an
[official companion guide](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/) which will help 
you through the platform. You may also find step-by-step tutorials at [the
OWASP web page](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/#div-tutorials). As 
mentioned in the same page, you can also try to use the 
[Tutorial Mode](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/challenges.html#tutorial-mode).

To run Juice shop follow the [instructions](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/running.html) 
at the official companion guide. The same information may be found in the 
README of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop).
